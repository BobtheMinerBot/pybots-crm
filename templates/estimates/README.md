# ISLA Builders — Estimate Template Library

## How Templates Work

Each template contains:
1. **Standard line items** for that service type
2. **Pricing formulas** (per sq ft, per unit, etc.)
3. **Scope description** boilerplate
4. **Common add-ons** that apply

When Luna helps build an estimate:
1. Pulls the right template based on service type
2. Applies measurements from site visit
3. Calculates quantities and pricing
4. Generates scope description
5. Suggests add-ons based on job specifics
